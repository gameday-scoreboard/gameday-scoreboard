Men's college basketball, recorded 2026-10-07 between seasons from

Recorded 2026-10-12 during LAD @ MIL (postseason, Bot 3rd), when ESPN's team
endpoint had already moved on to the next game:

Soccer does the same. Recorded 2026-10-12 during CRU @ BRA in Brazil's Serie A

(`.../schedule?fixture=true`) still listed the game on now first:

College football does the same. Recorded 2026-10-17 at 12:40 PM Central
during FLA @ TEX (halftime):

| File | Source |
| --- | --- |

College football games with no kickoff time yet, recorded 2026-10-14. ESPN
lists them at midnight Eastern with `timeValid: false` and a `shortDetail` of
"TBD" (Iowa, team 2294, is off on 10/17, so its next game is one of them):

| File | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `team_ncaa_iowa_tbd.json` | `.../football/college-football/teams/2294`, nextEvent is 401858497 IOWA @ MINN on 10/24, time TBD |

| `event_ncaa_tbd.json` | `.../college-football/scoreboard/401858497`, the TBD game on its own |
| `schedule_ncaa_iowa_tbd.json` | `.../college-football/teams/2294/schedule`, trimmed to events 6 to 12: the 10/9 final, five TBD games, then 11/27 at 12:00 PM EST |

Recorded 2026-10-15 at 9:41 AM Central (NBA preseason), for the rotation's
later-today cards:

| File | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `day_nba_20261015.json` | `.../basketball/nba/scoreboard?dates=20261015`, two games to come: TOR @ NY (no TV listed) and OKC @ HOU (NBA TV) |

Not from ESPN: `set_cases.json` is a table of `POST /gameday/set` requests and
the settings they leave in `/gameday/state`. `test_set.cpp` runs it through
`set_request.h`, and `tests/web/mock_device.py --selftest` through the device
page's mock, so the two answer the same way. Add a case there when a set key
or its limits change.
