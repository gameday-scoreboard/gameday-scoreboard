# Game Day Scoreboard firmware

ESPHome firmware for a standalone football scoreboard on an ESP32-S3 HUB75
controller. One top-level YAML per pinout: gameday.yaml (MoonHub75) and
gameday-scoreboard75.yaml (our controller board); each picks its pin map from
firmware/controllers/ and shares everything else via gameday-common.yaml.
Sibling repo: the iOS companion app at ~/development/gameday-scoreboard-ios (github.com/gameday-scoreboard/gameday-scoreboard-ios).

## Hard rules

- Commit as `bharvey88 <8107750+bharvey88@users.noreply.github.com>`. No
  Claude credit or Co-Authored-By lines on commits or PRs. Multiline commit
  messages via `git commit -F <file>`.
- This repo is PUBLIC and open source. Never commit handoffs, session
  notes, specs, plans or reviews here: only product code, CHANGELOG, README
  and the site. Maintainer notes are kept privately and loaded through a
  gitignored CLAUDE.local.md.
- Every parallel agent works in its own git worktree.
- Branch from `dev` and open PRs against `dev` (the default branch), never
  `beta` or `main`. Changes move `dev` to `beta` to `main` by promotion PRs
  only: `beta` only takes a PR from `dev`, and `main`, which is what
  customers run and what the live site deploys from, only takes a PR from
  `beta`. Release tags go on `main`. CI fails a PR into `beta` or `main`
  from any other branch and refuses to publish a tag that isn't on `main`.
- Product is not part of Apollo Automation. Brand is "Game Day Scoreboard".
- Decisions not to reopen without Brandon: OTA with no password, `api:` with
  no key, the device web page open ("panel trusts the home network"). Do not
  raise LAN hardening again. Prioritize customer-visible failures.
- Bump `version` in firmware/gameday-common.yaml and add a CHANGELOG.md
  section for every release; a tag without a matching section fails CI.
- ESPHome venv at ~/development/tools/esphome-venv flashes over USB and
  streams logs; Brandon's panel is gameday-2f6a70.local. Use `esphome
  compile`, not `esphome config`, to catch C++ errors. Host tests: `make -C
  tests`. Rebuild the web bundle with the venv's python (bare python3 on
  this Mac is 3.9.6, too old) after editing firmware/web/app.js.
