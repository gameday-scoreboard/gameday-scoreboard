# Game Day Scoreboard

![A final score on the panel: HBR 24, IRN 10, HBR WINS!](docs/wiki/src/assets/final-hbr-irn.jpg)

A standalone scoreboard for HUB75 LED matrix panels. Install it from your browser, join it to WiFi, pick your team on the panel's own web page, and it follows the game from ESPN by itself. Nothing else to run. It covers the NFL, college football, MLB, the NBA, the WNBA, men's college basketball, the NHL, MLS and the Premier League.

Watch the [full demo](https://install.gameday-scoreboard.com/) on the installer page. The [docs](https://docs.gameday-scoreboard.com/) cover setup, every setting, each sport's board, troubleshooting and running the firmware on your own board.

If you already use Home Assistant and want room lighting to celebrate too, [gameday-matrix](https://github.com/bharvey88/gameday-matrix) does the same thing through a blueprint.

## What it does

- Next-game card while you wait: both logos, season records, kickoff day and time in your timezone, and a ticker with the betting line, over/under, TV network and venue
- Live scoreboard at kickoff: scores, the game clock and quarter in large type under them, down and distance beneath that (red in the red zone), abbreviations in team colors with a gold underline under the team holding the ball, records under the logos, timeout pips, and a scrolling ticker with the last play (down and distance can go in the ticker too; the clock always has its own row)
- Full-screen splashes in your team's color for touchdowns, field goals, extra points and two-point conversions, the opponent's scores acknowledged in theirs, and a victory splash on a win
- Each sport has its own board: the inning, count, outs and a small diamond of the runners in baseball; the minute, stoppage time, latest goal and red cards in soccer; the period and clock in hockey and basketball, with the playoff series on the board in basketball and in the ticker in hockey. Home runs and goals get the fireworks too
- Lingers on your team's final (half an hour, ten minutes for baseball), then looks up the next game. In Favorite teams, After the final sets how long a final stays up (30 seconds unless you change it), and Live games moves to another game about a minute after its game ends
- Live games: follows a random game in progress in the leagues you choose and moves on when it ends
- A device page that mirrors the panel, celebrates with it, lists the next three games in football and soccer, and holds every setting
- Up to 16 favorite teams from any league, cycling through the ones playing today, with the first four on a WizMote remote's numbered buttons
- Updates itself over WiFi from the device page when a new release is out, or on its own between 3 and 5 AM if you turn on Install updates automatically
- Adapts to one 64x64 panel (logos side by side, stacked scores) or one 128x64 panel or two 64x64 side by side (logos at the edges, big scores, records and pips in the middle); one firmware, the count is a setting

## Hardware

Building your own? [Runs on your own panel](https://install.gameday-scoreboard.com/diy/) lists the boards and panels it runs on, how to wire a bare ESP32-S3, and what differs from a Game Day Scoreboard.

- The Game Day Scoreboard controller (build `gameday-scoreboard75.yaml`), or an ESP32-S3 HUB75 controller on the [MoonHub75](https://github.com/MoonModules/Hardware/tree/main/MOONHUB75) pinout, with 16MB flash, octal PSRAM, and a button on GPIO0 (build `gameday.yaml`)
- One 64x64 HUB75 panel, or a 128x64 display: one 128x64 panel or two 64x64 side by side (one firmware; pick the size on the device page)

The MoonHub75 pinout, under the names ESPHome uses (that board's README calls the upper half R0/G0/B0):

| R1 | G1 | B1 | R2 | G2 | B2 | A | B | C | D | E | LAT | OE | CLK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 13 | 9 | 16 | 48 | 47 | 21 | 38 | 8 | 4 | 18 |

## Install

1. Open the [installer page](https://install.gameday-scoreboard.com/), pick whether yours drives one 64x64 panel or a 128x64 display (or two 64x64 side by side), plug the controller in over USB, and click Install. It's for the Game Day Scoreboard controller and any board on the MoonHub75 pinout. An early test controller on the scoreboard75 pinout has its own [scoreboard75 installer](https://install.gameday-scoreboard.com/install/scoreboard75/).
2. Click Next when the install finishes and enter your WiFi details when the dialog asks. If you skip it, the panel shows a QR code for the Game Day app and starts a hotspot named Game Day plus six letters and numbers, like Game Day 2f6a70; join it and a setup page opens.
3. Once it's on WiFi the panel shows a QR code for the Game Day app, then the `gameday-xxxxxx.local` name of its own page. Pick your team in the app, or open that name on your phone and pick it there. Until you pick a team or a mode, from that page, the Game Day app or Home Assistant, the ticker asks you to and gives the panel's IP address for phones that can't resolve `.local` names. Holding the controller's boot button for 1.5 seconds shows the name and the IP address again any time.

Team changes take effect immediately and survive reboots. Wrong panel size? Click the matching picture in the Setup card. Nothing needs reflashing to change teams or layouts.

## The device page

The device serves its own page: a live board that mirrors the panel (logos, score, clock, down and distance or the count and outs, timeout pips, last play), a team chooser with logos, search and a tab per league plus an "On now" tab listing today's games straight from ESPN (tap the side you want to follow), and the settings grouped in plain language. It is plain HTML and JavaScript embedded in the firmware, so it works with no internet beyond the logos and the "On now" tab, which your browser reads from ESPN. The page reads one JSON document from the device (`GET /gameday/state`) and writes settings back to `POST /gameday/set`, so it is not limited to what an ESPHome entity can carry.

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Show | My team, Favorite teams, or Live games: a game in progress picked at random from the leagues you choose, switching every minute unless you change Switch every (1 to 30 minutes) |
| Team | All 32 NFL teams, every FBS college football team, every MLB, NBA, WNBA, NHL, MLS and Premier League team and every Division I men's college basketball team, a tab per league, plus an "On now" tab |
| Timezone | Follows the browser's zone unless you pick one by hand; used for kickoff times |
| Ticker: Down and distance, Count and at-bat, Match stats, Last play, Pre-game odds and TV | Choose what scrolls along the bottom. One switch per sport for the game situation: down and distance in football, the count, outs, pitcher and batter in baseball, and goals, cards, possession and shots in soccer. The page shows only the ones for sports your panel follows |
| Opponent scores too | Turn the opponent's scoring splashes off if you only want yours |
| Favorites | Up to 16 teams in priority order. "Only today's games" keeps the playlist to the favorites playing today. The first four are the numbered buttons on a WizMote remote |
| Remote | Pair a WizMote: turn discovery on, press any button on the remote. ON/OFF, brightness and NIGHT buttons control the panel |
| Panels | One 64x64 panel, or one 128x64 panel or two 64x64 side by side. Changing it restarts the device |
| Firmware / Check for updates | The device checks this project's releases every 6 hours; an Install button appears on the page when a newer version exists and updates over WiFi |
| Install updates automatically | Off unless you turn it on. Installs a new release between 3 and 5 AM, never during a game the panel follows |
| Brightness, Panel on, Ticker speed, Showing | Panel brightness, panel on or off, ticker speed, scoreboard or clock page |
| Refresh scores, Reboot | Re-fetch right away, restart |

## Home Assistant is optional

The device runs on its own, but it is a normal ESPHome device. If Home Assistant is on the same network it will discover it with the controls worth automating: Team, Mode, Power, Brightness, Scroll Speed, Select Page with Page Next and Page Previous, Game Status, Last Play, Firmware, Install Updates Automatically, Check for Updates, Refresh Now, Reboot, Reset Wi-Fi, Factory Reset, IP, ESPN Data, Chip Temperature and the WizMote entities (Auto-Discovery, MAC Address, Status and Clear WizMote Pairing). Favorites, timezone, ticker options, splashes and the panel count are set from the device page only. Men's college basketball teams aren't in Home Assistant's Team list (it would be too long for an entity); pick them on the device page. The API has no encryption key in the prebuilt binary; build from YAML if you want one.

Game Live, Team Score and Opponent Score follow the game in Game Status, and the panel fires an `esphome.gameday_score` event on every score in that game (`team`, `opponent`, `play`, `points`, `team_score`, `opponent_score`, `sport`, `my_team`) and `esphome.gameday_final` when it ends. Values arrive as text. To flash a light when your team scores a touchdown:

```yaml
- alias: "Flash the lights on our touchdown"
  triggers:
    - trigger: event
      event_type: esphome.gameday_score
      event_data:
        play: touchdown
        my_team: "true"
  actions:
    - action: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: light.living_room
      data:
        flash: long
```

The [Home Assistant page](https://docs.gameday-scoreboard.com/using/home-assistant/) lists every field.

## Build it yourself

```
git clone https://github.com/gameday-scoreboard/gameday-scoreboard
cd gameday-scoreboard/firmware
esphome run gameday.yaml
```

`gameday.yaml` only names the build and picks the controller pin map from `firmware/controllers/`; everything else lives in `gameday-common.yaml`. The panel count is a saved preference applied at boot by `components/panel_layout`, so one binary serves both layouts. The scoreboard page is in `pages/gameday-live.yaml`, the ESPN logic in `components/gameday`, and the device web page in `firmware/web` (edit `app.js` or `app.css`, then run `python scripts/build_web.py` to refresh the embedded bundle). The theme and clock packages come from [hub75-studio](https://github.com/pavlov-net/hub75-studio), pinned to a commit.

## How it works

The `gameday` component asks ESPN's public site API for the team's next event, then polls that game, from the day's scoreboard in football and from the game's own scoreboard entry in the other leagues: every 15 minutes while the game is far off, every minute inside the last hour, every 10 seconds during the game, showing ESPN's clock as it arrives, and every minute for half an hour after the final (ten minutes for baseball). After a failed read it waits longer before trying again. The JSON is streamed through a filter on the device so a scoreboard of several hundred kilobytes never has to fit in memory at once. Score deltas between polls decide the splashes, the same rules the blueprint uses. Logos are ESPN's dark-background PNGs (the plain one when a team has no dark version), decoded and shrunk to 32x32 on the ESP32.

The parser and game logic have host tests: `make -C tests` (needs g++). The device page has browser tests against a mock of the panel's web server: in `tests/web`, run `npm ci` and `npx playwright install chromium` once, then `npm test` (needs Node and Python 3). To refresh the team list at the start of a season, run `python scripts/build_teams.py` and commit the regenerated header.

## Notes

- ESPN's API is unofficial and can change without notice. The device sends a curl-style User-Agent because ESPN's edge rejects unfamiliar ones.
- All HTTPS requests (ESPN, logos, firmware updates) are certificate-verified against the ESP-IDF bundle. If ESPN ever moves to a certificate authority outside that bundle, fetches will fail until a rebuild.
- Team logos are ESPN's and are fetched at runtime, not bundled.
- Fetching runs on its own task, so the panel animation keeps going while a document downloads.

### On your network

The panel is a score display, and it treats your home network as trusted.
Anyone already on your Wi-Fi can open its page and change the team, and
updates are not password protected. That is a deliberate trade: it keeps
setup to one tap in the app and keeps the panel working when your phone
is the only thing that knows it exists. It is not designed to be exposed
to the internet, so do not forward a port to it.
